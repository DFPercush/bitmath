# Bit Math Demo

This project was made to demonstrate how various arithmetic operations
like multiplication and division on integers and floats, can be built from
simpler operations like shifting, adding and subtracting.

The only point in running it is to test its own algorithms. A pocket
calculator is more useful. The real value is in examining the source
code to see what goes on under the hood in your CPU, and learn how
you can build your own electronic circuits or program an FPGA to do it.

Addition and subtraction are considered trivial. There are many places
on the internet that can show how to build an adder, and any HDL language
will have those operations built in.

## List of operations currently available

1. int64 increment
2. int64 decrement
3. int32 multiply
4. int32 divide
5. float32 multiply
6. float32 divide
7. int64 multiply
8. int64 divide
